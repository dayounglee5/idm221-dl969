### introduction
**have ya heard?**, a music discover app designed for superfans who crave deeper connections with their favorite artists. featuring curated playlists filled with niche trakcs, the app highlights songs that only the most dedicated listeners know. by collaborating with platforms like **ticketmaster** and **live nation**, **have ya heard?** offers personalized music recommendations after users buy concert tickets, creating an immerseive experience that extends beyond the live show. 

### problems 
for many fans, the excitement of a concert is often limited to the event itself, with no platform to extend the experience or discover new music related to the artist. concert-goers miss opportunities to explore hidden gems and niche tracks that could enhance their appreciation for the artist. 

### objective
our objective was to create an application to integrate exploration, emotional regulation, productivity enhancement, and entertainment value into your listening playlist by implementing the spotify profile and using a comprehensive database.

### our users
#### user 1
- avid music lover and listener
- enjoys going to concerts even when she doesn't know the artist that well
- still wants to be able to know the songs and sing along
- not a super fan

#### user 2
- is a super fan
- loves going to concerts and singing along to all the songs
- passionate about music and always finding new music
- will spend a lot of money on concert tickets, especially for an artist she is a superfan of


### our process
**<u>our goals**</u>

**goal 1**
- solving the issue of access to niche songs

**goal 2**
- implementing it into spotify's existing system and connecting it to concert ticket purchases

**goal 3**
- utilizing user information to compile lists of distinctive songs

**<u>our business concept</u>**

**the start**
- taking data from the superfans of that artist and finding what songs they frequently listened to

**the development**
- creating a playlist called **have ya heard?** filled with those "niche" songs that only the superfans know
- collaborating with platforms like **ticketmaster** and **livenation** to display these playlists after user buys tickets


### solution
#### <u>limitations</u>
**dependence on partnerships**
- the app's integration with platforms like **ticketmaster** and **live nation** is essential for delivering personalized concert-related recommendations. however, if these partnerships can't be secured or maintained, it may limit the app's ability to enhance the concert experience as intended

**niche audience appeal**
- while superfans are dedicated, they represent a smaller segment of the general music-listening audience. this could impact the app's ability to scale and attract a braod user base, limiting its reach and potential for growth

**competition with mainstream streaming services**
- major streaming platforms offer extensive music libraries and personalized playlists. competing with these well-established services for user attention may be challenging, especially if they already fulfill some of the app's niche discover features



### takeaways
#### <u>future applications</u>
**dsp data extension**
- would allow the app to leverage streaming data for more personalized and dynamic playlist curation
- integrating with dsps like spotify, apple music, or amazon music, this application could access user listening data

**building community**
- create a vibrant community of music lovers who share their experiences, discover new music, and connect with each other based on their moods and activities
- whether that is through discussion forums or collaborative playlists, users would be able to create this sense of belonging amongst people of like-minded interests

**record label collaboration**
- would enhance its content offerings, providing a unique experience for users, and create marketing opportunities that would benefit both the app and the labels


### my own takeaways
this was a project in partnership with the **measure of music conference**. we had two days to create an idea to pitch and compose a presentation displaying what data we used and how we used it. being my first time participating in this conference, it felt daunting because i was not confident in implementing the data and create something from that. i enjoyed working with my team, and hopefully this is something that can be developed into something more!
