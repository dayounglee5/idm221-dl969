### introduction
a mobile music venue designed to bring live performances directly to college campuses and local communities. fully equipped for live shows, the bus offers a unique concert experience that's accessible, exciting and free for all attendees. 

### problems 
concerts have been increasingly difficult to attend due to high ticket prices, making them unaffordable for many fans. beyond the cost, issues like inconvenient locations and scheduling conflicts often make it challenging for people to see their favorite artists live. these barriers leave fans frustrated and can limit access to live music experiences.

### takeaways
#### <u>future applications</u>
**dsp data extension**
- would allow the app to leverage streaming data for more personalized and dynamic playlist curation
- integrating with dsps like spotify, apple music, or amazon music, this application could access user listening data

**building community**
- create a vibrant community of music lovers who share their experiences, discover new music, and connect with each other based on their moods and activities
- whether that is through discussion forums or collaborative playlists, users would be able to create this sense of belonging amongst people of like-minded interests

**record label collaboration**
- would enhance its content offerings, providing a unique experience for users, and create marketing opportunities that would benefit both the app and the labels


### my own takeaways
this was a project in partnership with the **measure of music conference**. we had two days to create an idea to pitch and compose a presentation displaying what data we used and how we used it. being my first time participating in this conference, it felt daunting because i was not confident in implementing the data and create something from that. i enjoyed working with my team, and hopefully this is something that can be developed into something more!
