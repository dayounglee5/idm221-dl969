### tools used

### introduction
goodreads is a popular social cataloging platform for book lovers, allowing users to track their reading, write reviews, and discover new books based on recommendations and community interactions. however, despite its widespread usage, many users feel that the website and app are outdated in terms of design and user experience. the goals of this projects was to explore how a redesign would improve the platform's usability, user engagement, and overall appeal, while retaining its core functionality.

### problems 
1. **outdated user interface**: the current design felt cluttered and lacked a modern design, such as a clean layout, intuitive navigation, and a strong visual heirarchy.
2. **inefficient shelving and book management**: the process of adding books to shelves and managing "to-read" lists is awkward. there was no easy way for user to bulk organize and a way to filter or sort their shelves.
3. **weak community interaction**: despite being designed as a social platform, goodreads lacked robust community interaction features. its discussion forums and groups are outdated and hard to navigate.

### objective
the primary objective of the redesign was to modernize the platform, enhance user engagement, and improve the user experience across both web and mobile.

### my own takeaways
being the first design project i have ever worked on, this was a great learning process for me. i learned the importance of aligning design decisions with both user needs and business goals, teaching me to appreciate the value of design, continuous feedback, and effective communication. i learned to understand why design is so important, and that all because it looks pretty, it's not the most user-friendly.
