# about  me
my name is dayoung lee and i am currently a student studying at drexel university, a part of the music industry program on the business track. i have two minors, one in business administration, and the other in UXID (user experience and interactive design), where i wish to blend my interests for my love in music and make a meaningful impact on the music industry. these two minors reflect my commitment to developing a well-rounded skill set that will serve as a strong foundation for my future career.

before entering my first year at drexel, i took a gap year spending it in korea, where i worked for a platform called wonderwall, a program that allows creative artists, including musicians, actors and actresses, and anyone in the creative field to share their expertise in their field with others who use the platform. i translated their content from korean to english, allowing more international users to have the ability to use this platform.

currently, i’m working at chorus, a start-up that directly connects artists with their superfans, as an artist relations research intern where i research and analyze fan engagement and ticket sales for mid-tier artists, compiling weekly reports and maintaining a database of venues and capacity to support decision-making for artist booking and promotions. 

before chorus, i had the opportunity to work at sony music entertainment’s epic records, where i supported the sync licensing team by managing deal points in the licensing database, assisting with the preparations of sync licenses, and collaborating with the clearance team to ensure proper licensing for film, television, and other media productions. 

other than that, my dream is to find innovative ways to combine my two passions in technology and music. Whether that is through data analytics, digital platforms, or user-centered designs, i want to explore the limitless possibilities at the intersection of these fields. 

on my free time, i am either reviewing books on goodreads or creating a new playlist for the month!
