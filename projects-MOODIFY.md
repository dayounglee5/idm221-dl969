### introduction


### problems 
existing music recommendation systems lack the ability to deliver curated and customizable playlists tailored to individual moods and curious preferences (spotify research)

### objective
our objective was to create an application to integrate exploration, emotional regulation, productivity enhancement, and entertainment value into your listening playlist by implementing the spotify profile and using a comprehensive database.

### our process
**how users experience moodify**

*insert flow from presentation*



### solution
#### <u>limitations</u>
**mood subjectivity**
- moods are interpreted differently whereas one song can evoke different moods/feelings in multiple subjects

**data quality**
- more users are needed to have a better end result

**limited catalog**
- if the app's library is limited, users may receive repetitive or irrelevant recommendations

**backend development**

### takeaways
#### <u>future applications</u>
**dsp data extension**
- would allow the app to leverage streaming data for more personalized and dynamic playlist curation
- integrating with dsps like spotify, apple music, or amazon music, this application could access user listening data

**building community**
- create a vibrant community of music lovers who share their experiences, discover new music, and connect with each other based on their moods and activities
- whether that is through discussion forums or collaborative playlists, users would be able to create this sense of belonging amongst people of like-minded interests

**record label collaboration**
- would enhance its content offerings, providing a unique experience for users, and create marketing opportunities that would benefit both the app and the labels


### my own takeaways
this was a project in partnership with the **measure of music conference**. we had two days to create an idea to pitch and compose a presentation displaying what data we used and how we used it. being my first time participating in this conference, it felt daunting because i was not confident in implementing the data and create something from that. i enjoyed working with my team, and hopefully this is something that can be developed into something more!
