    <h3>my own takeaways</h3>
    <p>being the first design project i have ever worked on, this was a great learning process for me. i learned the importance of aligning design decisions with both user needs and business goals, teaching me to appreciate the value of design, continuous feedback, and effective communication. i learned to understand why design is so important, and that all because it looks pretty, it's not the most user-friendly.</p>
