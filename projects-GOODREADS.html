    <h1>goodreads redesign</h1>
    <h3>introduction</h3>
    <p><b>goodreads</b> is a popular social cataloging platform for book lovers, allowing users to track their reading, write reviews, and discover new books based on recommendations and community interactions. however, despite its widespread usage, many users feel that the website and app are outdated in terms of design and user experience. the goals of this projects was to explore how a redesign would improve the platform's usability, user engagement, and overall appeal, while retaining its core functionality.</p>
    <h3>tools used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>figma</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>problems with the current website</h3>
    <b>outdated user interface</b>
    <ul>
        <li>the current design felt cluttered and lacked a modern design, such as a clean layout, intuitive navigation, and a strong visual hierarchy</li>
    </ul>
    <b>inefficient shelving and book management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>the process of adding books to shelves and managing “to-read” lists was awkward. there was no easy way for the user to bulk organize and a way to filter or sort their shelves</li>
    </ul>
    <b>weak community interaction</b>
    <ul>
        <li>despite being designed as a social platform, goodreads lacked robust community interaction features. its discussion forums and groups are outdated and hard to navigate</li>
    </ul>

    <p>the primary object of the redesign was to modernize the platform, enhance user engagement, and improve the user experience across both web and mobile.</p>

    <h3>process</h3>
    <u>low fidelty wireframes (mobile)</u>
    <p>this layout focused on a user experience that prioritizes discovering new books while maintaining quick access to the user's reading progress. at the top, a large horizontal carousel allows users to browse featured books easily. below, there's a reading challenge progress bar paired with quick access buttons for "reading," "want to read," and "read" sections, helping users manage their book lists seamlessly.</p>

    <h3>takeaways</h3>
    <p>
        <u>future appliations</u>
        <ul>dsp data extension</ul>
        <li>would allow the app to leverage streaming data for more personalized and dynamic playlist curation</li>
        <li>integrating with dsps like spotify, apple music, or amazon music, this application could access user listening data</li>
        <ul>building community</ul>
        <li>create a vibrant community of music lovers who share their experiences, discover new music, and connect with each other based on their moods and activities</li>
        <li>whether that is through discussion forums or collaborative playlists, users would be able to create this sense of belonging amongst people of like-minded interests</li>
        <ul>record label collaboration</ul>
        <li>would enhance its content offerings, providing a unique experience for users, and create marketing opportunities that would benefit both the app and the labels</li>
    </p>
    <h3>my own takeaways</h3>
    <p>this was a project in partnership with the <b>measure of music</b>. we had two days to create an idea to pitch and compose a presentation displaying what ata we used and how we use it. being my first time participating in this conference, it felt daunting because i was not confident in implementing the data and create something from that. i enjoyed working with my team, and hopefully this is something that can be developed into something more!</p>
